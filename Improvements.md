If you have extra time or want to practice your new React skills, here are some ideas for improvements that you could make to the tic-tac-toe game which are listed in order of increasing difficulty:

- [x] Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.

- [x] Bold the currently selected item in the move list.

- [ ] Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.

- [ ] Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.

- [ ] When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.

- [x] When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
